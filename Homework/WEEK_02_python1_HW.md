### Python 1 Homework Exercises

1. **From the command line**, create a new directory for this homework called "python1-hw", enter this directory, and create a new file called "hw1.py". Open this file with your favorite text editor.

2. Define the following variables:
   - A variable called "i" containing the value 5
   - A variable called "d" containing the value -9.41
   - A variable called "s" containing the phrase "I love homework!"
   - A list called "numlist" containing 6 random numbers of your choosing
   - A list called "strlist" containing 6 random strings/phrases/etc. of your choosing
   - A dictionary called "bookdict" with 5 key:value pairs. Each key:value pair should be ...

3. For each variable, create a print statement following this paradigm, "My new variable <variable> is <type> and contains <values>.
Example - the print statement for "strlist" might look like this: "My variable strlist is <type 'list'> and contains ['hi', 'hello', 'hey', 'goodday', 'sup g', 'yo', 'goodday']."
Run the your script to verify that each print statement is correct.

4. Create an additional print statement for each list variable to obtain a printed result like, "My variable strlist contains the values hi, hello, hey, goodday, sup g, yo, goodday."
Run the your script to verify that each print statement is correct.

5. Use the dictionary method, .items(), to print the 3rd (key, value) pair in bookdict.
