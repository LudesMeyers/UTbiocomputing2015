### Python 3 Homework


1. The python module `os` is very useful for interfacing with your computer's **o**perating **s**ystem. One useful function in this module is `os.listdir(<path_to_directory>)`, which lists the contents of a given directory.
Write a function called `find_text_files()` which takes a single argument (the name of a directory) and returns a **list** of all file names in that directory that have the extension `.txt`. For this, you'll also need to use the string method `.endswith()` (look it up to see how to use it!). Place this function in a script. When you run the script from the command line, the script should print "Your directory has <n> text files," where <n> is the number of files.

2. The file "lots\_of\_code.py" contains lots of code. Clean up this script such that the script now uses 3 functions, rather than having computations throughout the code.

3. Write a script which accomplishes the following tasks:
   + Task 1
   + Task 2
   + Task 3
