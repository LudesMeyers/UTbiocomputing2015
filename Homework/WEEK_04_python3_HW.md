### Python 3 Homework


1. The python module `os` is very useful for interfacing with your computer's **o**perating **s**ystem. One useful function in this module is `os.listdir(<path_to_directory>)`, which lists the contents of a given directory.
Write a function called `find_text_files()` which takes a single argument (the name of a directory) and returns a **list** of all file names in that directory that have the extension `.txt`. For this, you'll also need to use the string method `.endswith()` (look it up to see how to use it!). Write a script which contains this function. When you run the script from the command line, the script should print "Your directory has \<n\> text files," where \<n\> is the number of files.

2. The file "lots\_of\_code.py" contains lots of code. Clean up this script such that the main computations are now inside functions, which the body of the script calls. The goal should be to have XXX functions.

3. Write a script which accomplishes the following tasks (hint - each task should be a function that the main body of code calls):
   + Task 1
   + Task 2
   + Task 3
