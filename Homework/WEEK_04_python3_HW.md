### Python 3 Homework


1. The python module `os` is very useful for interfacing with your computer's **o**perating **s**ystem. One useful function in this module is `os.listdir(<path_to_directory>)`, which lists the contents of a given directory.

Write a function called `find_text_files` which takes a single argument (the name of a directory) and returns a list of all file names in that directory that have the extension `.txt`. For this, you'll also need to use the string method `.endswith()` (look it up to see how to use it!)
