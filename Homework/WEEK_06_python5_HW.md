## Homework for the Python 5 Testing module

Write a beautiful script with three functions. 

 1. The first function should read in the (csv file)[WEEK_06_python5_HW.csv], save it as a list, remove the header, 
 and return the dataset as a list.

 2. The second function should compute the amount of money spent per trip. Check *(not manually!!)*
that all of the Prices are floats, and fix them if they are not. Print to a logfile the total 
amount of money spent per trip.

 3. The third function should be a main() function that calls the other two.

Be sure to use print statements, assertions, and at least and one try-except clause as you write
in order to check your code. 


Bonus:

Write another function that calculates the amount of money spent per day and calculate an average value.
