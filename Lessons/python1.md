# Python I

## Operators
First, we have our standards: +, -, /, *. Some others you might not recognize include..
1. Modulus operator `%`, which gives the remainder, e.g. `12 % 5` will result in 2.
2. Exponent operator, `**`, e.g. `5**2` will result in 25.

We also have *logical operators*, which are used to make comparisons between statements. 

Symbol   | What it does | Example
---------|--------------|---------
  ==, is | Equals       |  `5 == 5` results in True <br> `5 == 7` results in False
  !=, is not | Not equals       |  `5 != 5` results in False <br> `5 is not 7` results in True
 > | Greater than       |  `5 > 6` results in False
 >= | Greater than or equal to |  `5 >= 4` results in True
< | Less than  |  `4 < 5` results in True
<= | Less than or equal to |  `4 <= 5` results in True

We can also perform multiple comparisons at once, using the keywords `and` and/or `or`. 
For example, 
``` python
# For "and," both logical statements must be true to result in True
5 == 5 and 6 == 6
>>> True
5 > 7 and 8 < 10
>>> False

# For "or," at least one logical statement needs to be true to result in True
5 > 7 or 8 < 10
>>> True
```
